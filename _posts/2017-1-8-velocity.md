Velocity is an extremely simple, powerful method for accurately measuring the rate at which scrum development teams consistently deliver business value. It is a metric that predicts how much work an Agile software development team can complete within a given sprint timebox.

Velocity is the average amount of work a team can do within a Sprint. For teams estimating their user stories using story points, their velocity is the number of story points for each completed user story in a Sprint. When a project involves multiple teams, estimating the velocity becomes more challenging because of the skill differences between the teams. The development team doing the work should always estimate the stories they will work on because teams have different scales. A story worth one story point for one team may be worth three for another.

Teams must work together for a few Sprints before they are able to start estimating their velocity; this is why it is important not to use the first Sprint of a new team as an indicator of expected velocity. For new teams, the Product Owner should measure two or three Sprints worth of work, perhaps through early prototyping, to start forecasting the project velocity. Velocity is important because it allows the teams to help estimate how much work they can deliver.

Velocity remains somewhat constant during a development project, which makes it a useful metric for estimating how long it will take a team to complete a software development project. If the product backlog has 300 story points, and the team is averaging 30 story points per sprint, it can be estimated that team members will require 10 more sprints to complete work. If each sprint lasts two weeks, then the project will last 20 more weeks.

Why do we need it?

We need velocity to:

- Predict how much scope can be delivered by a specific date
- Predict a date for a fixed amount of scope to be delivered
- Understand our limits while defining the amount of scope we will commit for a sprint


What influences velocity?

As in a car trip, there are factors that may influence our velocity:

-   Roadblocks - equated to impediments and issues
-   Fuel - equated to motivation, what drives us
-   Driver experience - equated to knowledge/expertise/competence developer
-   Car conditions - equated to dev environment
-   Visibility - equated toproject transparency
-   Directions - equated to project objectives
-   Traffic/driving rules - equated to processes
-   Destination - equated to product
