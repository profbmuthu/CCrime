One of the management techniques taking over the software industry is agile scrum. It is one of the original agile processes, originating in the early 1990’s. It is a disciplined framework for agile project management. It is made up of a few simple roles, structured meetings, and artifacts. Other agile processes have emerged since then, including Extreme Programming, Crystal, Adaptive Software Development, Feature Driven Development, and Dynamic Systems Development Method.

### Scrum

Scrum is not an acronym. It is a term borrowed from the sport of rugby, where it refers to a way of restarting a game after an accidental infringement or when the ball has gone out of play. The name “Scrum” was first used in this context in 1986 by Takeuchi and Nonaka.

Scrum originally was conceived for software development projects. In general, it is more important to know the business needs of the software or hardware than to have complicated technical documentation of the product. The scrum approach focuses on the business needs of projects when developing products and services. It is more important to get the user story and how the product will be used in the context of the customer.  

Scrum revolves around Scrum Teams. Scrum is a team-based iterative and incremental Agile methodology for tackling projects. It is about the communication between members of the team and it is about creating something that provides tangible benefits to stakeholders.It enables teams to deliver the right features on time, on budget, and with great quality. Scrum helps a software development organization adapt to changing business requirements and stakeholders’ needs while protecting the team from unproductive disruptions to their workflow. 

### Scrum principles

Scrum principles are the core guidelines for applying the Scrum framework and should mandatorily be used in all Scrum projects 
Principles are listed below

- *Empirical Process Control* - This principle emphasizes the core philosophy of Scrum based on the three main ideas of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.
    
- *Self-organization* - This principle focuses on today's workers, who deliver significantly greater value when self-organized and this results in better team buy-in and shared ownership; and an innovative and creative environment which is more conducive for growth.

- *Collaboration* - This principle focuses on the three core dimensions related to collaborative work: awareness, articulation, and appropriation. It also advocates project management as a shared value-creation process with teams working and interacting together to deliver the greatest value. 

- *Value Based Prioritization* - This principle highlights the focus of Scrum to deliver maximum business value, from beginning early in the project and continuing throughout. 

- *Time-boxing* - This principle describes how time is considered a limiting constraint in Scrum, and used to help effectively manage project planning and execution. Time-boxed elements in Scrum include Sprints, Daily Standup Meetings, Sprint Planning Meetings, and Sprint Review Meetings. 

- *Iterative Development* - This principle defines iterative development and emphasizes how to better manage changes and build products that satisfy customer needs. It also delineates the Product Owner's and organization's responsibilities related to iterative development. 

### Scrum Framework

SCRUM is not a process or a technique for building products; rather, it is a framework within which one can employ various processes and techniques.  It is a framework for organizing and managing work. It is simple to understand and deploy. It is the most common agile method used today.  It is based on a set of values, principles, and practices that provide the foundation to which one's organization will add its unique implementation of relevant engineering practices and specific approaches for realizing the Scrum practices. 

Scrum is a refreshingly simple, people-centric framework based on the values of honesty, openness, courage, respect, focus, trust, empowerment, and collaboration.   The framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules. Each component within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to Scrum’s success and usage.    The rules of Scrum bind together the events, roles, and artifacts, governing the relationships and interaction between them.
