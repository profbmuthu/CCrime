## Scrum Roles

Scrum defines three roles as part of a Scrum Team: 

- the ScrumMaster
- the Product Owner
- the Team

### Scrum Master

The ScrumMaster is a servant to the team. This person is responsible for ensuring the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum values, practices, and rules. The ScrumMaster ensures that meetings run smoothly and makes sure that everyone on the team has what they need to be successful. 

If the Scrum Team faces a Blocker, an issue that prevents progress, the Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring its quick resolution.

### Scrum Product Owner

The Scrum Product Owner is the person who owns the Product Backlog (a list of stakeholder needs for the product), ranks the work items by priority, and defines the acceptance conditions.

The Product Owner is responsible for everything that goes into the product release. The Product Owner meets with stakeholders, to collect the requirements.

The Product Owner is responsible for using his or her technical knowledge as well as knowledge of the team and of the business value to assess stakeholder needs and order the backlog in a priority sequence.

### Scrum Team

The Team is a self-organizing, self-managing, cross-functional group of people, such as developers, testers, information developers, architects, and any other participants the team nee s to deliver the work described in  he Product Backlog. The Team selects the Product Backlog and turns it into increments.

A Scrum Team consists of the Product Owner, ScrumMaster, and the Team. It is responsible for taking the work in the Product Backlog and figuring out how to deliver small demonstrable increments of the work in each Sprint while they are managing their own work in the process. Team members are collectively responsible for the success of each iteration and of the project as
a whole
