Planning is preparing a sequence of action steps to achieve some specific goal. When planning is carried, out methodically, it  reduces the time and effort to achieve the desired goal. Planning is the process of thinking about and organizing the activities required to achieve a desired goal. All activities are planned. Plan There are various types of planning. This article is limited to scrum planning. Scrum includes three levels of planning: 

- Release Planning, 
- Sprint Planning, 
- Daily Scrums.

### Release Plan

Release plan is one of the essential steps in scrum journey. Stake holders define their requirements which is captured. Release Plan shows what stakeholders can expect from the completed project. The plan defines the teams work style, and what progress they can expect at the end of each of the Sprints that make up the release. 

The Release Plan focuses on how the team will turn the vision for the project into a winning product by identifying goals, Product Backlog priorities, risks, features, and functionality.

### Sprint planning

In Scrum, every iteration begins with a sprint planning meeting. It is a collaborative effort involving a ScrumMaster, facilitating the meeting, Product Owner, clarifying the details of the product backlog items and their respective acceptance criteria, and the Scrum Team, who define the work and effort necessary to meet their sprint commitment. At this meeting, the Product Owner and the team negotiate which stories a team will tackle that sprint. 

This meeting is a time-boxed conversation between the Product Owner and the team. It’s up to the Product Owner to decide which stories are of the highest priority to the release and which will generate the highest business value, but the team has the power to push back and voice concerns or impediments.

When the team agrees to tackle the work, the Product Owner adds the corresponding stories into the sprint backlog. 


### Daliy Scrum

In Scrum, on each day of a sprint, the team holds a daily scrum meeting called the "daily scrum.”  The Scrum team gathers in front of their taskboard to discuss the progress made yesterday, goals for today, and any impediments blocking their path.

- What have I done since the last Scrum meeting (yesterday)?
- What will I do before the next Scrum meeting (tomorrow)?
- What prevents me from performing my work as well as possible?

Meetings are typically held in the same location and at the same time each day. Ideally, a daily scrum meeting is held in the morning, as it helps set the context for the coming day's work.  This meeting should not exceed 15 minutes. If members of the team need to discuss an issue that cannot be covered in that amount of time, we recommend they attend a sidebar meeting following the standup. This allows team members to attend meetings that directly involve their work, instead of sitting through irrelevant meetings. Unfortunately, daily Scrums often last longer than 15 minutes. To compensate, many teams use stop watches or timers to uphold the time limitations. Also, to limit distracting small talk, many teams employ a talking stick or mascot, which a team member must hold to speak in the meeting. Upon finishing an update, the talking stick is then passed to the next team member, who reports, and so on.
